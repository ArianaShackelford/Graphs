#NOTES:

#trying to find the vertex that is farthest away from the input

#Using a DFS/DFT sounds logical because it will find the longest route the quickest

#account for two paths of the same length, and return the one with the smaller number id. 

#if there is no parent, return -1


#QUESTIONS:

# Does it matter which direction I traverse? is there a way to do that?

# Do I want to do this recursively?

#what's the difference between traversal and searching? can I still return something with a traversal?

#Do I need to create a graph class?
